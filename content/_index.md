I'm a programmer, entry-level cybersecurity specialist and system administrator who sometimes does graphic design.
[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is my operating system of choice, and [radiant.nvim](https://git.devraza.giize.com/devraza/radiant.nvim) (my bespoke distribution of [neovim](https://neovim.io)) is my text editor of choice.

I also happen to be a devoted rustacean and a devout follower of the self-hosted way of life.

My skills in programming and scripting languages I've used so far are as follows:
- Advanced: `Python`, `Rust`
- Intermediate: `Nix`, `Go`
- Beginner: `Julia`, `Lua`, `C`

Other tools that I often work with include git, Linux in general, Inkscape, and GIMP.
