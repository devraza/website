I'm a programmer, entry-level cybersecurity specialist, system administrator, and aspiring graphic designer.
[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is my operating system of choice, and [radiant.nvim](https://git.devraza.giize.com/devraza/radiant.nvim) (my bespoke distribution of [neovim](https://neovim.io)) is my text editor of choice.

I also happen to be a devoted rustacean and a devout follower of the self-hosted way of life.

My skills in programming and scripting languages I've used so far are as follows:
- Advanced: `Python`, `Nix` 
- Intermediate: `Rust`, `Go`, `E-Lisp`
- Beginner: `Julia`, `Lua`

However, I consider myself able to work to a reasonable degree with any modern programming language.

Other *tools* that I can work with include `git`, `linux`, `inkscape`, and `GIMP`.
