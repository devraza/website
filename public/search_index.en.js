However, what if you wanted an adblocking system that was a bit deeper? Something that doesn't require a browser extension, and gives you a consistent adblocking system? This is where DNS-level adblockers like AdGuard Home or Pi-hole come in.\nDNS?#\nDNS stands for Domain Name System. It's what points URLs like https://duck.com to an IP address (like 52.142.124.215), making it much easier to find things on the internet.\nDNS-level adblockers work by filtering out queries for URLs pointing to IP addresses serving ads. In this blog post, I'll use blocky as an example of one such adblocker for demonstration purposes.\nSetting up blocky#\nNixOS configuration#\nThere's a configuration option for blocky provided by NixOS, so you can enable and configure it in your NixOS config:\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Why isn't it running?\n        \n        You might need to reboot after running a nixos-rebuild switch, or move/kill any process running on port 53 for this to work.\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Custom DNS mapping\n        \n        You can use blocky to map a domain of your choice to an IP of your choice - refer to the documentation for more information.\n\n    \n\nHere, I've used two upstream nameservers for blocky to forward valid DNS requests to (since blocky doesn't do any DNS resolution itself - except for custom mapping, detailed later). One is Cloudflare's DNS (1.1.1.1) and the other is Quad9 (9.9.9.9).\nAs indicated by lines 6 through 11, you need to add lists containing URLs you want to be filtered from your DNS requests.\nMaking it work everywhere#\nThe thing is, you'll need to set the IP address of the machine running blocky as a nameserver for all of your workstations - it just won't recieve any requests otherwise, so it won't be doing any adblocking if you don't do this.\nOf course, if you've got a router worth keeping around, you should be able to set a network-wide DNS resolver, and you can point this to your blocky-running machine in your router's settings.\nHowever, what if you wanted to have this work everywhere you go, perhaps on a portable laptop? Well, if you're using Tailscale or Headscale you can just can edit the nameservers you use in your VPN's settings and set it to the IP address of the device running blocky. This way, any device on your VPN can utilise blocky and have a functioning DNS-level adblocker no matter where you are.\nIf you're looking to setup headscale, I've made a blog post about it.\nFinishing thoughts#\nWith the existence of browser extensions doing the same thing adblockers like blocky and Pi-hole can, not everyone is going to need something this sophisticated. I think something like this is better suited to those looking for better coverage in their adblocking, or something that gives more control over DNS requests - for example, to easily setup custom DNS mappings or to restrict access to certain websites.\n","id":"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/adblock-blocky/","title":"DNS-level adblock on the go with blocky"},"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/btrfs-raid-setup/":{"body":"Introduction#\nWhat is RAID?#\nShamelessly copying from the relevant Wikipedia page:\n\nRAID (/reɪd/; redundant array of inexpensive disks or redundant array of independent disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical data storage components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.\n\nThat definition works well enough in case you don't already know what RAID is, which I doubt is the case for anyone reading this post.\nWhy use it?#\nEver had a hard drive containing important data - without any backups - fail? Or, a little less likely, had a mission-critical file server break for a few hours because a drive failed? These are the two biggest problems that RAID solves.\nThat's great, but how do I use it?#\nAnd finally, we have the main body of this blog post! While frustatingly looking up how to do slightly weird things with RAID using btrfs, I found the lack of documentation annoying - so, I thought I'd make this blog post to aggregate a bunch of commands.\nAnd so, the list:\nRAID1#\n\nSetting up RAID1 with two disks:\n\nSetting up RAID1 when you already have a disk with some data on it and want to add another:\n\n\nRAID0#\n\nSetting up RAID0 with two disks - exactly the same as with RAID1:\nYou can also continue to add more devices. The total storage available at the end of the process is the sum of the storage available on each drive:\n\nSetting up RAID0 when you already have a disk with some data on it and want to add another:\n\n\nNested RAID levels#\nBtrfs also supports RAID10 (or RAID1+0) which is a combination of RAID1 and RAID0 as demonstrated by the following image:\n\nHowever, as you can see, RAID10 requires n disks where n is an even number greater than or equal to 4. Furthermore, if you tried using devices of varying sizes, space would likely be wasted. So what would you do if you had 3 devices, with, for example, sizes of 1TB, 500GB, and 500GB?\nA possible solution here would be to split the 1TB drive into two equal partitions of 500GB, and pass them to btrfs as independant drives.\nTheoretically, you could also combine the two 500GB drives into a RAID0 partition and combine them through RAID1 with the 1TB drive (creating a nested RAID01/RAID0+1 array), but this seems to be unsupported by btrfs.\nIn general, setting up a RAID10 array with btrfs looks like this:\n\nUseful resources#\n\nbtrfs disk usage calculator - I found this somewhat useful, but it won't tell you how to get whatever configuration you set up to work\nThe Wikipedia page on nested RAID levels\n\n","id":"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/btrfs-raid-setup/","title":"RAID with btrfs"},"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/hoaxes-overview/":{"body":"Introduction#\nIn recent times, hoaxes have become increasingly prevalent as the internet continues to expand and as more people use social media.\nMisinformation is on a rise - though this is information which isn't really new, the current state of things is horrible, and things really shouldn't be the way they are.\nI aim for this to be a brief blog post detailing the effect of hoaxes on society, focusing on why they're so harmful.\nWhat exactly is a hoax?#\nPut simply, a hoax is made-up information, be it a story or something else. Hoaxes are created with the intent of spreading false information - for a immense variety of reasons, from jokes and causing embarrassment to provoking politic or social change1. I won't discuss the causes of hoaxes further in this blog post.\nThe effect of hoaxes#\nHoaxes can cause significant damage to their targets if formulated cleverly. For example:\n\nThe stock price of Apple Inc. fell significantly in October 2008 after a hoax story was submitted to CNN's user-generated news site iReport.com claiming that company CEO Steve Jobs had suffered a major heart attack. The source of the story was traced back to 4chan.\n\nExcerpt from the Wikipedia 4chan page\n\n\nWith the incredible presence of social media in our lives, spreading harmful misinformation like that above can be as simple as making a few posts - they don't even need to be very convincing!\nWhat makes matters worse is how gullible the general population is, even those educated in this sort of thing - this shows just how much influence the internet and it's contents have on us.\nI would like to clarify that I'm not suggesting that people should avoid using the internet to gather information - while its reliability is incredibly questionable, the accessibility and openness it provides far beats traditional methods of gathering information (books and such). My suggestion is that people should be much more careful with how they interpret information on the internet,\nand perform their due diligence in their research into whatever they're aiming to learn; people should make sure that what they're reading is accurate before absorbing any information (here's your tl;dr).\nThat's about it for this blog post, as it was meant to be a brief way of expressing my thoughts on the matter. Thanks for reading!\n","id":"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/hoaxes-overview/","title":"An overview on hoaxes"},"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/home-server-security/":{"body":"Introduction#\nHome server security is pretty often overlooked from what I can tell.\nAny device accessible from the internet has some degree of\nvulnerability in the current era of the internet. I aim for this\ndocument to detail methods to amend the contemporary cybersecurity\nchallenges faced by most homelabbers.\nJustification in Depth#\nOf course, my statements about home servers needing some security\nmeasures put in place aren't baseless. My own experience, as well as\nthat of a sizable number of people on the wonderful\nlemmy community at\nselfhosted@lemmy.world shows that home servers are endlessly 'knocked'\non, and that login attempts to services like SSH are made. Here's a\nsnippet from my fail2ban filter to\nverify this point:\n\nWithin the past few minutes, I've already got a few IP addresses from\nall over the world taking a peak at my services. If I had my SSH port\nset to the standard 22, I could have expected a few rogue login\nattempts to have been made, too.\nAnd, speaking of not having my SSH port set to the standard 22, I'll\nnow move on to what you should be done to secure a home server. One\nthing that I think should be noted, however, is that security doesn't\nneed to be very strong, and you generally don't need to go too far out\nof your way with security measures (though this definitely depends on\ninvdividual circumstance). Honestly speaking, you probably don't\nhave competent black hats looking to get in to your server - what you\nprobably do have, however, are a bunch of script kiddies and\nperversive bots.\nThe list#\nThe fairly basic stuff you'd need to do in this case doesn't make much\nroom for detail. So, here it all is in the form of a simple list (I've\nincluded the relevant NixOS configuration where I think it'd be\nuseful1):\n\n\nMove your SSH daemon to a non-default port, like 3291.\n\n\n\nForce public key authentication with SSH and disable root logins.\n\n\n\nSet up a pretty basic firewall - something like ufw would do the trick.\n\n\n\nThis probably doesn't need to be said, but use strong passwords!\n\n\nHost a fail2ban instance to ban hosts making bruteforce attempts.\n\n\nI think that's all there is for almost everyone, and is basically the\nminimal amount of effort a home server administrator should do.\nPersonally, I would prefer to enforce a VPN connection in order to\naccess my personal services for that extra layer of security (because\nwhy'd they need to be exposed to the internet?). This can be done faily\neasily with tailscale, and for the slightly more paranoid -\nheadscale is a\nviable...alternative? Anyways, I've got a blog post that explores\nheadscale in a little more detail, which might be worth checking out.\nWell, that's all I wanted to say. It's been a while since my last blog\npost, and the inspiration for this one came seemingly randomly - I hope\nsomeone finds this useful.\n1\nNaturally, you shouldn't just copy and paste the snippets into your own config. Do your research first!\n\n","id":"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/home-server-security/","title":"Home server security"},"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/nfc-misconceptions/":{"body":"\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Alert\n        \n        I made a mistake while writing this blog post - somehow forgetting that security isn't unambiguous. You can actually skim NFC chips from a certain distance\n(having a limited distance is still an important factor though!), and though I think some of what I said below still applies you're better off ignoring it all.\nThere are, of course, a whole range of problems with skimming NFC chips from a distance so my point - don't be so worried - would still stand.\nEither way, I recommend you take this with a grain of salt.\n\n    \nIntroduction#\nNFC (short for Near-Field Communication) is the set of communication protocols which allow for near-field communication between two electronic devices.\nOne of the most prominent uses of this technology are contactless transactions - this includes services like Google and Apple Pay as well as all of your contactless-enabled cards.\nIt's been a while since my last blog past, but this one will be brief too - I'm writing here for the sake of clearing up some misconceptions people have about NFC.\nThe Misconceptions#\nInspiration#\nWhile talking with a friend on a WhatsApp group chat a few days ago about a program I found on my jailbroken iOS device - Aemulo - I was\ninformed of 'subway skimmers'; devices that could supposedly read data from contactless-enabled devices (via NFC) and would be able to emulate them.\nThe idea behind the above example was that someone with malicious intent could place such a device in a public location and take their contactless devices for their malicious purposes.\nWhen I heard of this, my first thought was: hoax, and I think that it was rightfully so.\nWhat exactly is wrong with this?#\nSeveral things. I'm no expert in cybersecurity - everyone's a student in some way, but I was sure that NFC was, as it's name implies, for near-field communication.\nI'm repeating myself here, but that's kind of the point. Various reliable resources, including Wikipedia, show that NFC has a maximum range of only a few centimetres - which makes sense, no?\nAnd yet, whatever source my friend had for 'subway skimmers' gave the impression, or otherwise stated, that it would work within a radius of a few feet, which is just impossible.\nUpon voicing my doubts, I was then told that 'with a powerful enough antenna, it's possible'. Hoaxes sure are convincing, aren't they? Unfortunately, I am not able to find the source of my friend's misinformation.\nSee, NFC only works within a few centimetres anyways. Even if it could magically work within a radius of a few feet, you've got to take in the electromagnetic interference\nthat the clothes and wallets people have would bring to any malicious device. The point of electromagnetic interference is especially true over a huge area of a few feet (relatively), where you've got several NFC-enabled devices.\nWhere it's actually an issue#\nOf course, that isn't to say there aren't any issues with NFC and malicious readers - I'm just saying that the word getting around is horribly unrealistic.\nFor example, a realistic example of a malicious NFC reader would be one placed on the card slots in cash machines - you get:\n\n\nThe short range (&lt; ~20 cm)\n\nOnly one device\n\nLots of devices to read!\n\nAnd so, you've got someone so much more realistic that poses an actual threat!\nConclusion#\nThe information above, which I deem accurate, is there. What I suggest be taken away from this is pretty much the same as what is was for my blog post on hoaxes - do some fact-checking!\n","id":"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/nfc-misconceptions/","title":"Misconceptions about NFC"},"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/selfhost-search-engine/":{"body":"Introduction#\nSearXNG, put in its own words, is a 'free internet metasearch engine'.\nNote that it describes itself as a metasearch engine specifically - unlike your traditional search engine like Google or Bing, SearXNG does things a little bit differently:\nIt aggregrates the results produced by search services like those aforementioned, and feeds them back to you.\nBecause of this key detail and a great deal of effort by those who've helped shape it, SearXNG protects your privacy, and does so very well:\n\nPrivate data from requests going to the search services it aggregrates results from is removed\nIt does not forward anything to any third parties through search services\nPrivate data is also removed from requests going to the results pages\n\nFurthermore, SearXNG can be configured to use Tor.\nHowever, the aspect of privacy isn't the only great selling feature of the engine; from my use of the engine so far, it's also great at...searching (is that a surprise?). The fact that it's a metasearch engine plays a key role in this,\nas it provides SearXNG the ability to pull content more efficiently and gives you the ability to further tailor your experience.\nSetting up SearXNG#\nInstalling the service#\nAs you may have expected if you've used NixOS for a while, searxng is packaged and has a service on NixOS. This makes setting it up just that much easier.\nTo get started, place somewhere in your system config the following:\n\nThe snippet above starts the searx systemd service for listening on port 8888, and assumes a base_url of https://search.devraza.duckdns.org.\nNow that we've got the actual searx instance running, we can now set up a reverse proxy allowing the service to be accessed remotely (whether this is within your local network or across the internet is up to you).\nSetting up a reverse proxy#\nWhat is a reverse proxy?#\nBefore I get started with the technical details of setting this up, I'd like to briefly clarify what a reverse proxy exactly is (to my understanding).\nLet's get the wikipedia definition of reverse proxy out of the way first:\n\n[...] a reverse proxy is an application that sits in front of back-end applications and forwards client requests to those applications. [...]\n\nHowever, you might be confused as to what this actually means; I'll give an example of the usage of reverse proxies to better explain this:\n\nSuppose you've got a few services running on a server (for demonstration purposes, let's name these x, y and z), each running on their own unique port.\nAssuming you had a domain, and wanted to access all of these services from their own unique sub-domains (e.g. x.yourdomain.com, y.yourdomain.com and z.yourdomain.com), you would have to use a reverse proxy.\nThis reverse proxy would take in requests from clients going to sub-domains, and forward these requests to the appropriate port on your machine for the service being requested.\n\nThe concept should be clear now, if it wasn't already.\nUsing NGINX to set up the reverse proxy#\nNGINX is a popular web server that supports the creation of virtual hosts and the usage of reverse proxies. To accomodate our searx instance, we append the following to our NixOS server configuration:\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Note\n        \n        The expression highlighted above is used to dynamically adjust the location NGINX will forward requests to, depending on your searx config\n\n    \n\nAfter saving your changes and rebuilding your server's system configuration (as usual), you should have a working private instance of SearXNG that you can access using the serverName you've given it.\nSet your browser to use this as your search engine using the relevant documentation (with Firefox this is as easy as right-clicking on the URL after opening up the page and clicking a button).

At least, on the surface...\nNot FOSS? What do you mean?#\nThere's a quite popular saying within the free and open-source software community, which goes along the lines of:\n\nIf you aren't paying for the product, then you are the product.\n\nWhich makes perfect sense. It's the modern era so anything significant is powered by some form of modern technology, data is the new oil, and so on.\nIn exchange for offering you 'free' services, companies collect and use your data;\nwhile there supposedly are laws in place preventing the inconcensual collection of data in most countries around the world, your personal data may still be traded unethically and inconsensually.\nI personally am of the opinion that these laws are worth absolutely nothing if people aren't educated in how their data is being used, and what specifically is being collected.\nBut I digress, and that's a blog post for another time.\nI also think it's quite unfortunate that users of paid services still have their personal data collected in the unethical manner outlined above, despite the fact that they are paying for the service...\nIn the context of Tailscale: while their clients are all open-source, their control server - the thing that's managing and rerouting everything going through what they advertise as your 'secure' VPN, isn't.\nYou've got no idea what this thing is doing with the traffic it recieves.\nHeadscale#\nFor every problem, there's probably a solution somewhere. And luckily for this one (which may or may not actually be a problem for you), we've got Headscale as our solution.\nHeadscale's a self-hostable, open-source alternative to the Tailscale control server, and aims to 'provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for their projects and labs'.\nInstalling on NixOS#\nMoving on to installing and setting up Headscale on NixOS.\n\nThis starts up the headscale systemd service on our host machine at port 7070. After that, we make Headscale available over the clearnet with an NGINX reverse proxy, per the usual:\n\nAnd that's it. A self-hosted, truly open-source Wireguard®-based VPN is now at your fingertips. Enjoy! Oh, but please read the conclusion before doing that:\nConclusion#\nFor those of you who wish to have access to something like Tailscale but value your privacy above all, you would genuinely be greatful for Headscale.\nHowever, I've found that some are fine with what Tailscale does provide in regards to FOSS, and are satisfied by the raw convenience and simplicity of a non-selfhosted Tailscale control server - exactly what it hopes to provide, as shown by their self-description on their website: 'a zero-config, no-fuss VPN [provider]'.\nOr you could just settle with bare Wireguard®.\n","id":"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/selfhost-tailscale/","title":"Take control of tailscale with headscale"},"https://devraza.giize.com/blog/server-hardware-selection/":{"body":"Introduction#\nI see a lot of people worryingly mistaken about what a server needs (specifically, a home server). Some think that a bland and incredibly ignorant '20% budget for CPU, 30% for GPU, and the rest for the rest' plan for selecting hardware is good enough (at least, before choosing specific items) - you can't exactly be wrong when choosing\nhardware, but this is very, very far from right.\nRequirements#\nServer hardware needs to be low-power and resource-efficient - so as not to waste any money unnessarily, obviously. Your budget will strongly impact the specifications you can get your hands on, but I would think that even $200 is enough for a decent home server - depending on what you want to do with it.\nKeep in mind that you could always repurpose an old laptop or desktop lying around; it's cheap, and you get what may be a surprisingly decent machine.\nPower consumption#\nThe difference between low peak and low idle power should be noted in particular. Running costs can get very high if you don't work to moderate power consumption, and probably wouldn't be something you would ignore when it comes to home servers.\nUsage of the server#\nNaturally, how a server will be used will affect pretty much everything about the hardware chosen for it. For example, if you're looking to stream games remotely, you'd go for a (perhaps powerful) dedicated GPU and would likely invest in some high-speed internet solution.\nAs indicated by the above example of the GPU, you need to be very specific with what you choose - do you need a powerful GPU or do you not? After all, one of the last things you would want, ever, is money going to waste on something you don't need, or failing to buy something that meets your expectations.\nConclusion#\nI only gave two points of interest when selecting a server - looking at the numbers alone, this might seem like hardly anything to consider at all. My reasons for this are:\n\nPower comumption is one factor that people often forego thinking about, and an extremely important one at that.\nBuilding on top of the previous point, you (probably) aren't stupid. Knowing (albeit at a very basic level) what to look out for should be enough.\nIt would be extremely difficult for me, or anyone else for that matter, to provide a truly complete solution to everyone's needs for a home server.\n\nWell, that's it.
